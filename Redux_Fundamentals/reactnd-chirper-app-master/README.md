# Chirper

## Project Walkthrough:

The project I'm be building is called “Chirper”. 
Building this simple Twitter clone will help me practice improving the predictability of an 
application's state; establishing strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; 
and identifying what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside 
of React components.

### Install:
* Clone / download this folder.
* Run this in terminal:
```
cd reactnd-chirper-app-master

npm start
